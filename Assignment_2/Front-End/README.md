## Workflow

1. Project Setup: I start by setting up a new React project using a tool like Create React App or configuring my own build system. This involves installing dependencies, organizing the project structure, and setting up build scripts.

2. Component Development: I design and develop individual components of my application. Components are reusable, self-contained units of UI that can be function components or class components.

3. State Management: I decide on the approach for managing application state. I can use React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for local component state or choose a more advanced state management solution like Redux or MobX for global state management.

4. Routing (if applicable): If my application requires multiple pages or views, I implement routing using a library like React Router. I define routes and corresponding components to handle navigation and render different views based on the URL.

5. API Integration: I connect my application to external APIs to fetch and update data. I can use the fetch API or libraries like Axios or the useEffect hook to make HTTP requests and handle responses.

6. UI Styling: I choose a CSS approach for styling my application's components. I can use CSS modules, inline styles, CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

## Testing

Cheked on Netlify that Application is properly depoloyed and running

## Deployment

To deploy the application, I followed these steps:

1. Signed up for a Netlify account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and linked my GitHub account to Netlify.
2. Selected the GitHub repository I wanted to deploy from the available options.
3. Configured the deployment settings, including specifying the build command and the production folder.
4. Reviewed the deployment settings and made sure everything was correctly set up.
5. Clicked the "Deploy" button in Netlify.
6. Netlify automatically fetched the latest code from the linked GitHub repository and built the application.
7. Once the build process was completed, Netlify deployed the application to a live system.
8. I received a live URL for the deployed application, which is accessible at [Netlify Deployment Link](<https://fenil-t3.netlify.app/>).

By following these steps, the frontend of the application was successfully deployed using Netlify.
